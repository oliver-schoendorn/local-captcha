# Ajax Form

This example will show you how to use this plugin within SPA's or with dynamically built forms.
BEWARE: This example is not working as it is. The `Form.html` file represents the result of an imaginary form
rendering process. The `FormController.php` is part of an imaginary REST API or similar.
